Official Twitter and Periscope plugin for WordPress. Embed content and grow your audience. Requires PHP 5.6 or greater.

== Description ==

Embed Twitter content, improve sharing on Twitter, convert your web audience into Twitter or Periscope subscribers, and easily track visits to your website from Twitter advertising.

Requires PHP version 5.6 or greater.

= Embed Twitter content =
Embed Twitter content by pasting a URL, customizing a shortcode, or in a widget area.

* [single Tweet](https://github.com/twitter/wordpress/wiki/Embedded-Tweet "single Tweet embed")
* [profile timeline](https://github.com/twitter/wordpress/wiki/Embedded-Profile-Timeline "Twitter embedded profile timeline")
* [list timeline](https://github.com/twitter/wordpress/wiki/Embedded-List-Timeline "Twitter embedded list timeline")
* [collection](https://github.com/twitter/wordpress/wiki/Embedded-Collection-Timeline "Twitter embedded collection")
* [Moment](https://github.com/twitter/wordpress/wiki/Moments "Twitter embedded Moment")

Customize embed display to match your theme. Choose a light or dark background, customize link and border colors, and customize timeline template components through your site's WordPress administrative interface.

The plugin automatically customizes an embed's template text to match the locale of your site, optimally loads Twitter's JavaScript to improve site speed and extensibility, and handles advanced use cases such as articles loaded asynchronously via the WordPress API.

= Grow your Twitter audience =

Automatically generate link previews for your site's URLs shared on Twitter using [Twitter Cards markup](https://github.com/twitter/wordpress/wiki/Cards) . Easily identify your site and author Twitter accounts through your site and user administrative interfaces.

Add a [Tweet button](https://github.com/twitter/wordpress/wiki/Tweet-Button) to public posts to encourage your visitors to share your content on Twitter. Visitors may see recommended accounts to follow after sharing your content including your site and its authors.

Add a [Follow button](https://github.com/twitter/wordpress/wiki/Follow-Button) to convert your site visitors into Twitter subscribers.

Add a [Periscope On Air button](https://github.com/twitter/wordpress/wiki/Periscope-On-Air-Button) to convert your site visitors into Periscope subscribers.

= Improve Twitter advertising campaigns =

Easily add a Twitter website tag to your website to track the effectiveness and [conversion rates](https://business.twitter.com/en/help/campaign-measurement-and-analytics/conversion-tracking-for-websites.html) of Twitter advertising campaigns or [build tailored audiences](https://business.twitter.com/en/targeting/tailored-audiences.html) to target your Twitter advertisements for your website audience.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I change an embedded Tweet's background and link colors to match my site's theme? =

The Twitter plugin for WordPress includes a settings page with options to set a light or dark theme and choose a link or border color used in embedded Tweets and timelines.

= My custom link color and border color do not appear in embedded Tweets or timelines =

Your site may have a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Security/CSP/Introducing_Content_Security_Policy) blocking Twitter's JavaScript from inserting your custom styling into the widget.

You may have configured an embedded search timeline widget with a non-default link color. Your stored widget configuration overrides your page or themeâ€™s configuration.

= Does the Twitter plugin add additional tracking of my site's visitors? =

The Twitter plugin for WordPress makes it easier to explicitly include Twitter features and functionality on your WordPress site. No additional tracking is added as a result of our plugin code's execution on your server(s).

Twitter widgets and buttons load Twitter's widgets.js library through the WordPress JavaScript queue. Read more about [how Twitter for Websites widgets respect user privacy](https://dev.twitter.com/web/overview/privacy).

Twitter advertising trackers are only included on the page when invoked by the site using the `twitter_tracking` shortcode or placing the Twitter advertising shortcode in a widget area. Read more about [Twitter's policies for conversion tracking and tailored audiences products](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20171365).
